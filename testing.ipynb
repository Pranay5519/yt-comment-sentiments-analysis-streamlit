       " {'text': \"Hi Dr Huberman......new to the channel but seems genuinly produced after watching a few videos I think your standpoint on the issue is unbiased from an experiienced based caring person.\\n\\nYour field of study is an absolute revolutionaly important thing to have done with your life and i truley comend you on your xhannel and its videos.\\n\\nI am not a specialist in anything related maybe apart from drug food and music therapy which i am a master.\\n\\nEverybody has an individual requirement for nutritional intake which fluctuates over time constantly due to lifestyles, being missinformed.\\n\\nI think that that a discusion needs to take place not just about the food, supplements, micro nutrients vits and mins.\\n\\nWe need to look at the medicinal tablets we are given from a young age all the way into senioship at an accelerated rate....the pills we eat and consume everyday they call prescriptions. \\n\\nA dodtor prescribes you think its good for you......next thing yiu know your on 6 pills a day all multicoulour and you dont even question it. \\n\\nMosg medication is produced from a pefrochemical refining process only been around since the last 140 years or so before that kt was traditional hollistic natural remedies taken from a shamen or which doctors and old school nans remedys.\\n\\nI would like to open a massive important diverse debate on this pist if at all possible...... on one side intelectual proffesionals scientists, nutritionists, doctors, health exercise, nutritionists etc.....with on the other side everyone such as traditional medicinal practioners, religeos fasting technique specialists, life long meat eaters vegetarians pescetarians the morbidley obese to the anemic or people with or have recovered serios gut problems, dieters and everyone inbetween to openly discuss debate with out restriction there experiences thoughts from a personal caring aspect to better educate the importance of what we consume is one of the most important things critical to all aspects of health.\\n\\nIll open with a personal story of my late Grandad Jack Edge an absolute gentlemen untill the day he died in an alciemers ward a few years ago. He was a keen outdoorsman with a wife who cooked him the same meals through out a 65 year marriage religeosly. Large meat based fatty meals mainley. He was not a drug taker or a drinker or a smoker. Mylate  nan on the other side was a shut in who cooked and ate and consumed what she wanted cigaretes whiskey cake all on the menu......She controlled my grandads food intake because he knew which of her meals he liked fair enough. \\n\\nAny way grandad started taking statins and verios other tablets from about the age of 50 or so more and more i just kept saying oh whats that blue one there do hes say for me blood or skin or what eber he had been told.\\n\\n\\nI beieve the medicines they give us make us more ill and dependant on that and more medicines for the point of money making in fhe pharmacutical industry. I think its also a form of populafion control. \\n\\nAnd i believe that all pharmacuticals from paracemol to amti depressants to benzodiazepens to statins and tbe rest of the never ending list of tablets they make predominangly in India. \\n\\nIm not saying all of them affect in a negative way but alot do. \\n\\nAny way i believe the main cause an increase of new health conditions including Alzheimer's and dementia and other mental health issues over the past 100 years or so can be correlated to the increase in doctor prescribed pharmaceuticals and drugs my reasoning for this is these are all new these are all new these were new health conditions whether it be mental or physical and they've all come from somewhere will there be spraying crops gmos the Organic debate the meat debate the the main debate everybody's talking about at the moment anyway to finish my story my Grandad died in an Alzheimer's ward and within days of being there he was lost when are the visited him free of the people around him fell over and I think two of them died most horrific experience of a place that I've ever visited in my life monan on the side I lived in both for a 4 years stage shrewd and stoic and on point until does she passed away at the age of 90 I'm getting a bit emotional as I write this back to my original point I think it's important to open a debate coming from all angles professionals to the individualls.\\n\\nI suppose this might already be going on ob some chanel maybe one of your threads but for the greater goodness well of invinate knowledge lets start one right now if you will.\\n\\nLove is all we have in this world and its in everyhing. \\n\\nThanks fir listening\\n\\nJonafhan Coates \\nWolverhampton .\\nEngland.\",\n",

Just to note—5g/day of creatine is the standard amount shown to saturate skeletal muscle, but studies suggest that may not be enough to fully support the brain. Since muscle takes up the bulk of creatine first, higher intakes (sometimes 10–20g/day in research on cognition, mood, and neuroprotection) have been explored for brain benefits. So while 5g is the baseline, the brain may need more to see a measurable effect',\n",

       " {'text': 'In his video \"Food & Supplements for Brain Health & Cognitive Performance,\" Andrew Huberman explores the connection between diet and brain function. He highlights several key nutrients and food choices that can enhance cognitive performance and overall brain health.\\n\\nKey Nutrients for Brain Health:\\n\\nOmega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA & DHA): Crucial for the structural integrity of neurons, Huberman recommends a daily intake of 1.5 to 3 grams of EPA, which can be found in fish, chia seeds, walnuts, and soybeans [01:57, 04:26].\\n\\nPhosphatidylserine: This compound, abundant in meat and fish, directly supports neuronal function [04:40].\\n\\nCholine: Essential for producing acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter vital for focus, choline is found in egg yolks, with a recommended intake of 500 mg to 1 gram per day [05:21].\\n\\nCreatine: Enhancing mood and motivation, a daily supplement of at least 5 grams of creatine monohydrate is suggested [06:54].\\n\\nAnthocyanins: Found in dark berries like blueberries and blackberries, these compounds may improve brain function by reducing inflammation [08:30].\\n\\nGlutamine: This amino acid, found in protein-rich foods and certain vegetables, can boost immune function and help control sugar cravings [09:53].\\n\\nFactors Influencing Food Choices:\\n\\nHuberman identifies three main signals that drive our food preferences:\\n\\nTaste and Mouthfeel: The sensory experience of food in our mouths plays a significant role in our choices [14:53].\\n\\nGut-Brain Signaling: The gut communicates with the brain, releasing dopamine in response to certain nutrients, which motivates us to seek out those foods again [18:15].\\n\\nBeliefs and Learned Associations: Our beliefs about a food\\'s health benefits can influence our physiological response to it [26:26].\\n\\nRewiring Food Preferences:\\n\\nThe video also suggests that it\\'s possible to change our food preferences over time. By consistently consuming healthy foods, we can retrain our brains to find them more rewarding. Pairing new, healthy foods with those we already enjoy can speed up this process [28:10]. He also cautions against consuming artificial sweeteners separately from foods that raise blood glucose, as this can disrupt blood sugar management [25:56].\\n\\nHuberman concludes by noting that while supplements are an option, it\\'s possible to obtain these essential nutrients through a well-balanced diet [12:02].',\n",

He was a keen outdoorsman with a wife who cooked him the same meals through out a 65 year marriage religeosly. Large meat based fatty meals mainley. He was not a drug taker or a drinker or a smoker. Mylate  nan on the other side was a shut in who cooked and ate and consumed what she wanted cigaretes whiskey cake all on the menu......She controlled my grandads food intake because he knew which of her meals he liked fair enough. \\n\\nAny way grandad started taking statins and verios other tablets from about the age of 50 or so more and more i just kept saying oh whats that blue one there do hes say for me blood or skin or what eber he had been told.\\n\\n\\nI beieve the medicines they give us make us more ill and dependant on that and more medicines for the point of money making in fhe pharmacutical industry. I think its also a form of populafion control. \\n\\nAnd i believe that all pharmacuticals from paracemol to amti depressants to benzodiazepens to statins and tbe rest of the never ending list of tablets they make predominangly in India. \\n\\nIm not saying all of them affect in a negative way but alot do. \\n\\nAny way i believe the main cause an increase of new health conditions including Alzheimer's and dementia and other mental health issues over the past 100 years or so can be correlated to the increase in doctor prescribed pharmaceuticals and drugs my reasoning for this is these are all new these are all new these were new health conditions whether it be mental or physical and they've all come from somewhere will there be spraying crops gmos the Organic debate the meat debate the the main debate everybody's talking about at the moment anyway to finish my story my Grandad died in an Alzheimer's ward and within days of being there he was lost when are the visited him free of the people around him fell over and I think two of them died most horrific experience of a place that I've ever visited in my life monan on the side I lived in both for a 4 years stage shrewd and stoic and on point until does she passed away at the age of 90 I'm getting a bit emotional as I write this back to my original point I think it's important to open a debate coming from all angles professionals to the individualls.\\n\\nI suppose this might already be going on ob some chanel maybe one of your threads but for the greater goodness well of invinate knowledge lets start one right now if you will.\\n\\nLove is all we have in this world and its in everyhing. \\n\\nThanks fir listening\\n\\nJonafhan Coates \\nWolverhampton .\\nEngland.\",\n",

       " 'In his video \"Food & Supplements for Brain Health & Cognitive Performance,\" Andrew Huberman explores the connection between diet and brain function. He highlights several key nutrients and food choices that can enhance cognitive performance and overall brain health.\\n\\nKey Nutrients for Brain Health:\\n\\nOmega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA & DHA): Crucial for the structural integrity of neurons, Huberman recommends a daily intake of 1.5 to 3 grams of EPA, which can be found in fish, chia seeds, walnuts, and soybeans [01:57, 04:26].\\n\\nPhosphatidylserine: This compound, abundant in meat and fish, directly supports neuronal function [04:40].\\n\\nCholine: Essential for producing acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter vital for focus, choline is found in egg yolks, with a recommended intake of 500 mg to 1 gram per day [05:21].\\n\\nCreatine: Enhancing mood and motivation, a daily supplement of at least 5 grams of creatine monohydrate is suggested [06:54].\\n\\nAnthocyanins: Found in dark berries like blueberries and blackberries, these compounds may improve brain function by reducing inflammation [08:30].\\n\\nGlutamine: This amino acid, found in protein-rich foods and certain vegetables, can boost immune function and help control sugar cravings [09:53].\\n\\nFactors Influencing Food Choices:\\n\\nHuberman identifies three main signals that drive our food preferences:\\n\\nTaste and Mouthfeel: The sensory experience of food in our mouths plays a significant role in our choices [14:53].\\n\\nGut-Brain Signaling: The gut communicates with the brain, releasing dopamine in response to certain nutrients, which motivates us to seek out those foods again [18:15].\\n\\nBeliefs and Learned Associations: Our beliefs about a food\\'s health benefits can influence our physiological response to it [26:26].\\n\\nRewiring Food Preferences:\\n\\nThe video also suggests that it\\'s possible to change our food preferences over time. By consistently consuming healthy foods, we can retrain our brains to find them more rewarding. Pairing new, healthy foods with those we already enjoy can speed up this process [28:10]. He also cautions against consuming artificial sweeteners separately from foods that raise blood glucose, as this can disrupt blood sugar management [25:56].\\n\\nHuberman concludes by noting that while supplements are an option, it\\'s possible to obtain these essential nutrients through a well-balanced diet [12:02].',\n",

I'm trtimg to get off of statins or take low dose statins and let my ldl cholesterol go back up. I was told the numbers for ldl were aet too low.

       "'Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to analyze and interpret data. The term \"deep\" refers to the fact that these ANNs have multiple layers, rather than just one or two.\\n\\nArtificial neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, where neurons process and transmit information through complex networks of interconnected nodes. In deep learning, this concept is extended to create models with hundreds or thousands of layers, each consisting of multiple processing units called artificial neurons.\\n\\nThe key characteristics of deep learning include:\\n\\n1. **Large datasets**: Deep learning requires large amounts of data to train the models.\\n2. **Hierarchical representation**: Each layer in a deep neural network represents an increasingly abstract level of abstraction, allowing the model to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data.\\n3. **Non-linear processing**: Artificial neurons are non-linear, meaning they can learn and represent more complex functions than linear models.\\n\\nDeep learning is widely used for various applications, such as:\\n\\n1. **Computer vision**: Object recognition, image classification, object detection, segmentation, and generation.\\n2. **Natural language processing (NLP)**: Text classification, sentiment analysis, language translation, and text summarization.\\n3. **Speech recognition**: Speech-to-text systems and voice assistants.\\n4. **Robotics and autonomous vehicles**: Perception, control, and decision-making.\\n\\nSome of the benefits of deep learning include:\\n\\n1. **Improved accuracy**: Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art performance in many applications.\\n2. **Increased efficiency**: Deep learning models can be parallelized, making them computationally efficient.\\n3. **Flexibility**: Deep learning models can be adapted to a wide range of tasks and domains.\\n\\nHowever, deep learning also has some limitations:\\n\\n1. **Data requirements**: Large amounts of high-quality data are required to train deep learning models.\\n2. **Computational resources**: Training large deep neural networks requires significant computational power.\\n3. **Interpretability**: Deep learning models can be difficult to interpret and understand, making it challenging to explain their decisions.\\n\\nOverall, deep learning has revolutionized many fields by enabling computers to learn from data like humans do.'"

       " {'comment': {'text': 'Fear can fix sleep. When I got hired at a job and was expected to show up, unless I was seriously ill, I went to sleep same time every night. The sheer fear of coming late to work was what worked for me in the end. Alot of people can only sleep and wake at a reasonable time if there is external pressure, like work, appointments, school, kids, etc. \\n\\nBut what do we do if for some reason we lose that external pressure? Then, we need to understand WHY we associate sleep with something that we don\\'t wanna do. Did something happen to you as a kid, where sleep became unbearable? Do the opposite for your own sleep. \\n\\nAlso, are you missing out on any task(are you losing something) by choosing to sleep at night? If so, what is it you are losing, is it control? Many people distract themselves from sleep because the night time is quiet and they cannot stand being in their own skin, feeling the feelings that want to come out. What feelings are you running from? Write them down. \\n\\nFurthermore, what task can\\'t wait until the next day? An important email? A doom scroll? You gotta make sleep NON-negotiable. No tasks should ever be allowed to interere sleep! Phone should be turned off and placed in another room. Physical alarm clocks, wall clocks, they are used instead.\\n\\nWhat night time routine do you have in place? My guess is none. As soon as the clock hits your decided \"winding down time\" (for example 10, if you fall asleep at 12 or 1), begin the list of the things that winding down time should consist of.\\n\\nThe items on the list can be anything that helps you relax. Face mask? Moisturizing? Flossing? Stretching? Coloring? Praying? ASMR? Feelings journal? Fiction reading? Whatever it is, it has to be something that doesn\\'t stimulate you into work mode (thinking/solving/conemplating/exploring/action mode). The day time is for grind, night time is for compassion. Sun VS moon. Compassionate mom VS mentor dad! Same goes for sleep VS wake time. Sleep is for kindness, calm, compassion, rest, relaxation, closure. Dim lights, turn on a relaxing tune and just sit somewhere comfortable in comfy clothes. Breathe, drink a cup of herbal tea. Get out of your head and get inside your BODY, feel your limbs, stretch your neck. Thank God for all the blessings He has shown you this day. Ask Him for help. Appreciate your body for carrying you around all your life. Don\\'t speak/use your voice, it gets you stimulated. Be silent or whisper gently. \\n\\nIn this way, you can slowly and gradually begin getting tired. And then, you slide into bed and just lay there, no expectations. When eyes are heavy, close them, listen to surroundings. Drift off without forcing anything. \\n\\nA night routine in this way is essential to train your body to associate sleep with something peaceful and restful, not just some other chore you gotta do or master on top of other chores. Sleep is for rest. It is for healing. It is your only time on the day when nobody is asking for anything or needing anything. It is time JUST for you, to let go of the day, and shut down. Life is tiresome, so sleep!\\n\\nIf you are waking at 2 pm right now and sleeping at 5, start by setting an alarm for 11 AM for 3 days in a row. Then 10 AM, 3 more days. Until you get to your ideal time. During the day, do chores, be outside, it will add to the fatigue. I promise, this method works. I have had bad sleep routine since my rebellious days in high school, I am a 34 year old woman now. I realized how much my irregular sleep was giving me anxiety and depression. \\n\\nGo out and buy some cheap sleep routine stuff that you genuinely enjoy. Get a new cool pencil case, get a scalp massager, get a good fiction. Make night time routine a time you ENJOY. This is what becomes sustainable in the long run - when you train how you even see sleep in the first place. It goes from \"ugh i gotta sleep soon\" to \"Awsome, i get to do my spa time, me-time soon!\"',\n",

       " {'comment': {'text': \"Summary: \\nCircadian Rhythm\\n- Circadian Rhythm are heavily influenced by sunlight exposure, which affect quality of sleep and alertness.\\n- You wake up because a particular hormone called cortisol is released from your adrenal glands. \\n- This starts a timer that says to your brain and body that in about 12 to 14 hours a different hormone, calling melatonin will be released from your pineal gland.\\n- During the day, adenosine levels build up with wakefulness, creating a ‘sleep drive. \\n- If we were in complete darkness, these rhythms of cortisol and melatonin would continue, but it would be somewhat later and later each day. Whereas, when light comes into your eyes, retinal ganglion cells communicates to this clock called the suprachiasmatic nucleus to time the cortisol and melatonin properly. \\n- Low solar angle: particular contrast between yellows and blues that triggers the activation of these cells. \\n- A lot of evidence that if you don't get your cortisol and melatonin rhythms right, there are tremendously broad and bad effects on cardiovascular health, metabolic effects, learning, depression, dementia.\\n\\nRecommandations \\n- Getting a minimum of 2 to 10 minutes of morning sunlight to reset the circadian clock. 30-60sec could be enough in very bright environments while no natural light could be enough in other. Being behind a glass is 50x less efficient. A phone light isn’t enough too because early in the day, your retina is not very sensitive. \\n- Avoiding bright light at night: if you need any, it’s best to have it low because retina sensors are more concentrated for light coming from above. \\n- Avoid blue filters troughout the day, reserve it for late in the evening \\n- Viewing light a few minutes later in the day when the sun is setting or around that time can help protect against the negative effects of light later in the day.\\n- Time food intake\\n- Time exercise \\n- Time drugs consumption \\n- All this will take 2-3 days to set the chemical\\n- If you're having trouble waking up early and feeling alert early in the day, you're going to want to try and get bright light exposure even before waking up because it will advance your clock.\\n- Yoga Nidra Benefits: Meditation techniques like yoga nidra and NSDR can help individuals better manage their sleep.\\n- Caffeine: Caffeine serves as an adenosine antagonist, blocking its receptor and keeping us alert. This is why we can get crash when they leave adenosine receptors. \\n- Naps and Focus: Naps can be beneficial for cognitive function and alertness because adenosine dip around 2-4pm. Many people get groggy probably because they're not sleeping as well as they should at night or as long as they should at night. And so they're dropping into REM sleep or deeper forms of sleep in the daytime. \\n- Wakefulness is driven by systems that increase epinephrine and dopamine. This is how work stimulants like cocaine, amphetamine, and prescription drugs like modafinil, armodafinil, and Adderall. Lot of people take Adderall. These can increase alertness but often lead to rebound effects and have addictive potential and quite bad effects. Safe supplements are:\\n    - Magnesium (especially magnesium threonate): improve sleep by increasing GABA, a calming neurotransmitter.\\n    - Theanine: 100-200 mg helps reduce mental activity and ease into sleep. Also used to reduce caffeine-induced jitters.\\n    - Melatonin \\n    - Apigenin: a chamomile-derived compound. 50mg promotes sleep but inhibits estrogen—so not recommended for those wanting to maintain estrogen levels (even men need it for cognition, libido, etc). \\nThese supplements can make some people so sleepy that waking up becomes difficult, so dosage should be adjusted.\",\n",

Unfortunately as a Paramedic I'm stuck working 12 hour shifts, 2 days of 0630-1830, then 2 nights of 1830-0630 (so there is a 24hr inbetween period from the second day shift to the first night shift, and then 4 days off before starting back on day shift (really only 3 days off, since you are working until 0630 on the first day off and then likely sleeping).\\n\\nNight shifts can be sporadic and we often get no rest / up all night or we are woken up abruptly by the phone in the wee hours of the night / morning (think 0300, 0430, etc). This is obviously terrible for our health - but what can I do to mitigate it? \\n\\nI currently take some melatonin after I get home from my night shift (around 0700 if we don't get stuck on OT) and attempt to sleep for as long as I can, usually waking up anywhere from noon to 1530ish. Blackout blinds help with that. I'll start wearing sunglasses on my way home after night shift as well. \\n\\nMy biggest fear is early onset dementia from this shift work, going from days to nights and nights to days - my circadian rhythm is non-existent and I'm sure REM sleep is affected greatly as well.\",\n",

I am a 63 year old Eurasian woman and I have not slept properly for the past 30 years. Even though I am not a shift worker, I \"sleep\" or rather, try to fall asleep only at around 8 or 9 am and I wake up around 4 pm. I have great difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep and also get disturbed by the day sounds going on around me. As much as I try to fall asleep during the night, I just cannot do so. Very recently, an adrenal adenoma was discovered in my left adrenal gland and I guess this is causing some hormonal imbalances. What would you recommend for me to change my timings to get my sleep timings in order? Staying awake continuously for a few days and viewing sunlight at dawn and at dusk? I\\'m now at a stage where I have not slept properly for nearly 3 weeks. I wish you could use me as a case study! But I would really appreciate a response/reply from you. Thank you for all that you do and for all the hard work and research you put in to your podcasts. Please try and help me.',\n",

For the past several years I’ve been going to sleep in the morning (when the sun is coming up) and waking up in the late afternoon/ early evening when it’s about to go down. I’ve been trying to change it for ages now without much effect. If I stay up for 24 or more hours and am totally wrecked, I still become more alert as the evening advances. Similarly trying to wake up slightly earlier every day doesn’t really work. I suspect my sleep quality is pretty poor, so when I get less than eight or nine hours, I feel pretty ill. However I do really want to fix this weird schedule as it’s impairing my ability to work, see people etc. and also having a negative impact on physical and mental health… Sorry this so long, but I’d be grateful to have this addressed at some point. Perhaps I just need to act like someone with jet lag and strong arm myself into a new schedule, but I haven’t managed to yet..',\n",

       " {'comment': 'Fear can fix sleep. When I got hired at a job and was expected to show up, unless I was seriously ill, I went to sleep same time every night. The sheer fear of coming late to work was what worked for me in the end. Alot of people can only sleep and wake at a reasonable time if there is external pressure, like work, appointments, school, kids, etc. \\n\\nBut what do we do if for some reason we lose that external pressure? Then, we need to understand WHY we associate sleep with something that we don\\'t wanna do. Did something happen to you as a kid, where sleep became unbearable? Do the opposite for your own sleep. \\n\\nAlso, are you missing out on any task(are you losing something) by choosing to sleep at night? If so, what is it you are losing, is it control? Many people distract themselves from sleep because the night time is quiet and they cannot stand being in their own skin, feeling the feelings that want to come out. What feelings are you running from? Write them down. \\n\\nFurthermore, what task can\\'t wait until the next day? An important email? A doom scroll? You gotta make sleep NON-negotiable. No tasks should ever be allowed to interere sleep! Phone should be turned off and placed in another room. Physical alarm clocks, wall clocks, they are used instead.\\n\\nWhat night time routine do you have in place? My guess is none. As soon as the clock hits your decided \"winding down time\" (for example 10, if you fall asleep at 12 or 1), begin the list of the things that winding down time should consist of.\\n\\nThe items on the list can be anything that helps you relax. Face mask? Moisturizing? Flossing? Stretching? Coloring? Praying? ASMR? Feelings journal? Fiction reading? Whatever it is, it has to be something that doesn\\'t stimulate you into work mode (thinking/solving/conemplating/exploring/action mode). The day time is for grind, night time is for compassion. Sun VS moon. Compassionate mom VS mentor dad! Same goes for sleep VS wake time. Sleep is for kindness, calm, compassion, rest, relaxation, closure. Dim lights, turn on a relaxing tune and just sit somewhere comfortable in comfy clothes. Breathe, drink a cup of herbal tea. Get out of your head and get inside your BODY, feel your limbs, stretch your neck. Thank God for all the blessings He has shown you this day. Ask Him for help. Appreciate your body for carrying you around all your life. Don\\'t speak/use your voice, it gets you stimulated. Be silent or whisper gently. \\n\\nIn this way, you can slowly and gradually begin getting tired. And then, you slide into bed and just lay there, no expectations. When eyes are heavy, close them, listen to surroundings. Drift off without forcing anything. \\n\\nA night routine in this way is essential to train your body to associate sleep with something peaceful and restful, not just some other chore you gotta do or master on top of other chores. Sleep is for rest. It is for healing. It is your only time on the day when nobody is asking for anything or needing anything. It is time JUST for you, to let go of the day, and shut down. Life is tiresome, so sleep!\\n\\nIf you are waking at 2 pm right now and sleeping at 5, start by setting an alarm for 11 AM for 3 days in a row. Then 10 AM, 3 more days. Until you get to your ideal time. During the day, do chores, be outside, it will add to the fatigue. I promise, this method works. I have had bad sleep routine since my rebellious days in high school, I am a 34 year old woman now. I realized how much my irregular sleep was giving me anxiety and depression. \\n\\nGo out and buy some cheap sleep routine stuff that you genuinely enjoy. Get a new cool pencil case, get a scalp massager, get a good fiction. Make night time routine a time you ENJOY. This is what becomes sustainable in the long run - when you train how you even see sleep in the first place. It goes from \"ugh i gotta sleep soon\" to \"Awsome, i get to do my spa time, me-time soon!\"',\n",

Here are the most powerful takeaways I noted — hope it helps others too:\\n\\n🧠 Two Forces Control Sleep & Wakefulness\\n\\nAdenosine – builds up the longer we’re awake, creating sleep pressure.\\n\\nCaffeine blocks adenosine receptors, making us feel alert.\\n\\nCircadian Rhythm – our 24-hour internal clock that regulates when we feel awake or sleepy.\\n\\n⚠ The most powerful factor that determines when we feel sleepy or alert is LIGHT — specifically sunlight.\\n\\n🌞 Sunlight Is the Master Regulator\\n\\nMorning sunlight triggers cortisol, our natural alertness hormone.\\n\\nGet sunlight within 30–60 mins of waking, ideally outdoors without sunglasses.\\n\\nLight sets your brain's central clock and tunes all your body’s clocks.\\n\\n🌇 Evening Sunlight & Darkness Matter Too\\n\\nViewing sunset helps signal day’s end to your circadian clock.\\n\\nDarkness = melatonin release (sleepy signal).\\n\\nBright light (especially 11PM–4AM) suppresses melatonin and dopamine — harming sleep, mood, and focus.\\n\\n💤 If You Can’t Sleep – Use the Body to Calm the Mind\\n\\nYou can’t force sleep with willpower, but you can use tools like Yoga Nidra, NSDR, breathing to calm the nervous system.\\n\\nThese train the body to shift from alertness to deep relaxation.\\n\\n📉 Start with Behavior Before Supplements\\nFix:\\n✅ Morning & evening light\\n✅ Sleep-wake consistency\\n✅ Exercise & food timing\\nThen (if needed): look into supplements.\\n\\n🙏 Thanks again, Dr. Huberman — your insights are life-changing! 🌅🧘\\u200d♂🧠💤\",\n",

       " {'comment': \"Summary: \\nCircadian Rhythm\\n- Circadian Rhythm are heavily influenced by sunlight exposure, which affect quality of sleep and alertness.\\n- You wake up because a particular hormone called cortisol is released from your adrenal glands. \\n- This starts a timer that says to your brain and body that in about 12 to 14 hours a different hormone, calling melatonin will be released from your pineal gland.\\n- During the day, adenosine levels build up with wakefulness, creating a ‘sleep drive. \\n- If we were in complete darkness, these rhythms of cortisol and melatonin would continue, but it would be somewhat later and later each day. Whereas, when light comes into your eyes, retinal ganglion cells communicates to this clock called the suprachiasmatic nucleus to time the cortisol and melatonin properly. \\n- Low solar angle: particular contrast between yellows and blues that triggers the activation of these cells. \\n- A lot of evidence that if you don't get your cortisol and melatonin rhythms right, there are tremendously broad and bad effects on cardiovascular health, metabolic effects, learning, depression, dementia.\\n\\nRecommandations \\n- Getting a minimum of 2 to 10 minutes of morning sunlight to reset the circadian clock. 30-60sec could be enough in very bright environments while no natural light could be enough in other. Being behind a glass is 50x less efficient. A phone light isn’t enough too because early in the day, your retina is not very sensitive. \\n- Avoiding bright light at night: if you need any, it’s best to have it low because retina sensors are more concentrated for light coming from above. \\n- Avoid blue filters troughout the day, reserve it for late in the evening \\n- Viewing light a few minutes later in the day when the sun is setting or around that time can help protect against the negative effects of light later in the day.\\n- Time food intake\\n- Time exercise \\n- Time drugs consumption \\n- All this will take 2-3 days to set the chemical\\n- If you're having trouble waking up early and feeling alert early in the day, you're going to want to try and get bright light exposure even before waking up because it will advance your clock.\\n- Yoga Nidra Benefits: Meditation techniques like yoga nidra and NSDR can help individuals better manage their sleep.\\n- Caffeine: Caffeine serves as an adenosine antagonist, blocking its receptor and keeping us alert. This is why we can get crash when they leave adenosine receptors. \\n- Naps and Focus: Naps can be beneficial for cognitive function and alertness because adenosine dip around 2-4pm. Many people get groggy probably because they're not sleeping as well as they should at night or as long as they should at night. And so they're dropping into REM sleep or deeper forms of sleep in the daytime. \\n- Wakefulness is driven by systems that increase epinephrine and dopamine. This is how work stimulants like cocaine, amphetamine, and prescription drugs like modafinil, armodafinil, and Adderall. Lot of people take Adderall. These can increase alertness but often lead to rebound effects and have addictive potential and quite bad effects. Safe supplements are:\\n    - Magnesium (especially magnesium threonate): improve sleep by increasing GABA, a calming neurotransmitter.\\n    - Theanine: 100-200 mg helps reduce mental activity and ease into sleep. Also used to reduce caffeine-induced jitters.\\n    - Melatonin \\n    - Apigenin: a chamomile-derived compound. 50mg promotes sleep but inhibits estrogen—so not recommended for those wanting to maintain estrogen levels (even men need it for cognition, libido, etc). \\nThese supplements can make some people so sleepy that waking up becomes difficult, so dosage should be adjusted.\",\n",

Unfortunately as a Paramedic I'm stuck working 12 hour shifts, 2 days of 0630-1830, then 2 nights of 1830-0630 (so there is a 24hr inbetween period from the second day shift to the first night shift, and then 4 days off before starting back on day shift (really only 3 days off, since you are working until 0630 on the first day off and then likely sleeping).\\n\\nNight shifts can be sporadic and we often get no rest / up all night or we are woken up abruptly by the phone in the wee hours of the night / morning (think 0300, 0430, etc). This is obviously terrible for our health - but what can I do to mitigate it? \\n\\nI currently take some melatonin after I get home from my night shift (around 0700 if we don't get stuck on OT) and attempt to sleep for as long as I can, usually waking up anywhere from noon to 1530ish. Blackout blinds help with that. I'll start wearing sunglasses on my way home after night shift as well. \\n\\nMy biggest fear is early onset dementia from this shift work, going from days to nights and nights to days - my circadian rhythm is non-existent and I'm sure REM sleep is affected greatly as well.\",\n",

I am a 63 year old Eurasian woman and I have not slept properly for the past 30 years. Even though I am not a shift worker, I \"sleep\" or rather, try to fall asleep only at around 8 or 9 am and I wake up around 4 pm. I have great difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep and also get disturbed by the day sounds going on around me. As much as I try to fall asleep during the night, I just cannot do so. Very recently, an adrenal adenoma was discovered in my left adrenal gland and I guess this is causing some hormonal imbalances. What would you recommend for me to change my timings to get my sleep timings in order? Staying awake continuously for a few days and viewing sunlight at dawn and at dusk? I\\'m now at a stage where I have not slept properly for nearly 3 weeks. I wish you could use me as a case study! But I would really appreciate a response/reply from you.

       " {'comment': \"🎯 Key points for quick navigation:\\n\\n00:00 *🛏️ Importance of Sleep and Wakefulness*\\n- Sleep and wakefulness govern mental and physical health.  \\n- Adenosine buildup during wakefulness creates sleep drive, and caffeine blocks this to promote alertness.  \\n- Circadian rhythms, regulated by light, define sleep-wake cycles.\\n04:18 *🌞 Role of Light in Circadian Rhythms*\\n- Cortisol and melatonin rhythms are set by exposure to light, especially sunlight.  \\n- Morning light triggers cortisol for wakefulness; melatonin release follows about 12-16 hours later.  \\n- Viewing sunlight through windows is less effective; outdoor exposure is ideal.\\n09:33 *🌅 Benefits of Morning and Evening Light*\\n- Morning light exposure (2-10 minutes) regulates circadian rhythms.  \\n- Evening light during sunset supports sleep-wake cycle stabilization.  \\n- Proper timing of light exposure improves cardiovascular and mental health.\\n16:39 *💡 Risks of Late-Night Light*\\n- Sensitivity to light increases after prolonged wakefulness.  \\n- Bright light at night (11 PM–4 AM) disrupts dopamine production and sleep quality.  \\n- Minimize nighttime light exposure to support healthy rhythms.\\n22:27 *🌞 Impact of Light on Sleep and Wakefulness*\\n- Light exposure affects the body's internal clock, with morning light advancing wakefulness and late-night light delaying it.  \\n- Consistent light anchors regulate hormones like cortisol and melatonin, improving focus, metabolism, and mood.  \\n- Poorly timed light exposure contributes to sleep issues, anxiety, and depression.\\n24:50 *💤 The Role of Naps and Yoga Nidra in Rest*\\n- Short naps (<1 hour) can boost alertness and learning but may cause grogginess if sleep quality is poor.  \\n- Yoga Nidra is a meditative practice enhancing relaxation and aiding the transition to sleep.  \\n- These practices train the nervous system to shift from alertness to calmness effectively.\\n27:14 *🧘 Using the Body to Control the Mind*\\n- Techniques like breathing exercises, body positioning, and light management help regulate sleep and wake cycles.  \\n- Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) practices reset the nervous system, enhancing alertness and emotional stability.  \\n- NSDR research shows it improves dopamine function and deliberate motor control.\\n30:03 *🌿 Supplements for Sleep and Wakefulness*\\n- Magnesium threonate, theanine, and apigenin can support sleep by influencing neurotransmitters like GABA.  \\n- Apigenin, derived from chamomile, may reduce estrogen, which requires caution for some individuals.  \\n- Prioritize behavior changes (e.g., light exposure, diet, activity) before considering supplements.\\n\\nMade with HARPA AI\",\n",

For the past several years I’ve been going to sleep in the morning (when the sun is coming up) and waking up in the late afternoon/ early evening when it’s about to go down. I’ve been trying to change it for ages now without much effect. If I stay up for 24 or more hours and am totally wrecked, I still become more alert as the evening advances. Similarly trying to wake up slightly earlier every day doesn’t really work. I suspect my sleep quality is pretty poor, so when I get less than eight or nine hours, I feel pretty ill. However I do really want to fix this weird schedule as it’s impairing my ability to work, see people etc. and also having a negative impact on physical and mental health… Sorry this so long, but I’d be grateful to have this addressed at some point. Perhaps I just need to act like someone with jet lag and strong arm myself into a new schedule, but I haven’t managed to yet..',\n",

If you can't take that light, artificial light will also work, especially high amounts of blue light in morning \\n\\n3. Get the sunset light inside your eyes, and no artificial light here, especially blue \\n\\n4. Avoid blue lights and alot of lights at night after 8pm and especially 11pm  to 4 am , it has adverse effects\\n\\n5. At night keeping lights below, ( like lower than your eyes, like on floor or small table) will work nicely\\n\\n6.Naps are not necessary but its your choice and if you feel groggy after taking them than you have  night sleep issue \\n\\n7. NSDR works best enhancing  a brain part ( I don't remember that) \\n\\n8. To fall asleep focus on body  (like breathing and relaxation)\",\n",
