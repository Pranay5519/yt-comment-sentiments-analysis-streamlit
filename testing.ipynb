       " 'In his video \"Food & Supplements for Brain Health & Cognitive Performance,\" Andrew Huberman explores the connection between diet and brain function. He highlights several key nutrients and food choices that can enhance cognitive performance and overall brain health.\\n\\nKey Nutrients for Brain Health:\\n\\nOmega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA & DHA): Crucial for the structural integrity of neurons, Huberman recommends a daily intake of 1.5 to 3 grams of EPA, which can be found in fish, chia seeds, walnuts, and soybeans [01:57, 04:26].\\n\\nPhosphatidylserine: This compound, abundant in meat and fish, directly supports neuronal function [04:40].\\n\\nCholine: Essential for producing acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter vital for focus, choline is found in egg yolks, with a recommended intake of 500 mg to 1 gram per day [05:21].\\n\\nCreatine: Enhancing mood and motivation, a daily supplement of at least 5 grams of creatine monohydrate is suggested [06:54].\\n\\nAnthocyanins: Found in dark berries like blueberries and blackberries, these compounds may improve brain function by reducing inflammation [08:30].\\n\\nGlutamine: This amino acid, found in protein-rich foods and certain vegetables, can boost immune function and help control sugar cravings [09:53].\\n\\nFactors Influencing Food Choices:\\n\\nHuberman identifies three main signals that drive our food preferences:\\n\\nTaste and Mouthfeel: The sensory experience of food in our mouths plays a significant role in our choices [14:53].\\n\\nGut-Brain Signaling: The gut communicates with the brain, releasing dopamine in response to certain nutrients, which motivates us to seek out those foods again [18:15].\\n\\nBeliefs and Learned Associations: Our beliefs about a food\\'s health benefits can influence our physiological response to it [26:26].\\n\\nRewiring Food Preferences:\\n\\nThe video also suggests that it\\'s possible to change our food preferences over time. By consistently consuming healthy foods, we can retrain our brains to find them more rewarding. Pairing new, healthy foods with those we already enjoy can speed up this process [28:10]. He also cautions against consuming artificial sweeteners separately from foods that raise blood glucose, as this can disrupt blood sugar management [25:56].\\n\\nHuberman concludes by noting that while supplements are an option, it\\'s possible to obtain these essential nutrients through a well-balanced diet [12:02].',\n",
